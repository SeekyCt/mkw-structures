# mkw-structures
Documentation of structures, classes and relevant functions in Mario Kart Wii. This is pseudo-c++, not code designed to compile properly - fields with unknown data types are left out with offsets being given in comments, among other simplifications.

All addresses are for the PAL version of the game.

Do whatever you like with this information as long as you credit all contributors to what you use.

## Contributing
Feel free to pull request with your own documentation. You may use any names you like for new types/symbols, but try to stick to the same general style. Make sure all addresses are for PAL.
